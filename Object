//In Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), an object is an instance of a class, encapsulating data and behavior, serving as the building block for creating modular and reusable code.
// Define a class named Object within the package CODEJAVA.javaobject
package CODEJAVA.javaobject;

// Object class to represent a generic object, in this case, a car
public class Object {
    // Declare a member variable to store the brand of the object (car)
    String brand;

    // Method to start the object (car) and print a message indicating it is starting
    public void start() {
        System.out.println(brand + " is starting.");
    }

    // Main method, the entry point of the program
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an instance of the Object class, representing a car
        Object myCar = new Object();

        // Set the brand of the car to "Toyota"
        myCar.brand = "Toyota";

        // Call the start method to indicate that the car is starting
        myCar.start();
    }
}
